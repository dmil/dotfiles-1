# Dot Files

My dot files, forked from https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles and modified
- Removed ZSH support
- Added some new scripts which get run automatically by `script/strap-after-setup`
- Added duti
- Probably made some other changes too

## Installation
Run with strap https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap

OR 

Run [`script/setup`](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/dotfiles/blob/master/script/setup)
after checkout to symlink (or copy) everything in this directory to your home directory.
